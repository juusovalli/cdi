/**
 * The lifecycle of a UIScoped component is bound to a browser tab.
 * <p>
 * Injection with this annotation will create a direct reference to the object
 * rather than a proxy.
 * <p>
 * There are some limitations when not using proxies. Circular referencing (that
 * is, injecting A to B and B to A) will not work. Interceptors and decorators
 * will not work.
 * <p>
 * The sister annotation to this is the {@link @NormalUIScoped}. Both
 * annotations reference the same underlying scope, so it is possible to get
 * both a proxy and a direct reference to the same object by using different
 * annotations.
